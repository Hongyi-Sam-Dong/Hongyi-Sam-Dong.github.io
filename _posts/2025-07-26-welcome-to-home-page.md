Biography:

Hongyi Sam Dong is a Master of Science student in Robotic Systems Development at Carnegie Mellon University and a recent graduate in Computer Science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where he was recognized on the Dean’s List and engaged deeply in both research and teaching. With a strong foundation in computer science and robotics, Dong is passionate about advancing intelligent systems through both academic research and industry practice.

Dong has contributed to cutting-edge projects in robotic motion planning and wireless signal modeling as a research assistant in the Parasol Lab and iSENS Lab at UIUC. His work has spanned visibility-based path planning for robotic arms, simulation infrastructure migration from ROS1 to ROS2, and RF propagation modeling using Wireless InSite. His research also involved collaborations with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and included contributions to a forthcoming academic publication.

In industry, Dong interned at Siemens Smart Infrastructure, where he played a key role in automating critical software update processes and improving the robustness of testing pipelines for building automation systems slated for a 2025 market release. His engineering efforts streamlined CI/CD workflows and significantly enhanced product reliability.

A strong advocate for teaching and educational tools, Dong served as a coding assistant for UIUC’s CS 124 and CS 357 courses, supporting over a thousand students and driving improvements in course management platforms. He is especially interested in the intersection of robotics, machine learning, and educational technology, with recent projects focused on self-supervised learning, neural network-based image reconstruction, and scalable web systems for classroom management.

Dong’s technical expertise includes Python, C++, ROS, PyTorch, SolidWorks, and advanced machine learning techniques. He continues to explore the frontiers of autonomous systems and intelligent infrastructure with a commitment to innovation, equity, and practical impact.
